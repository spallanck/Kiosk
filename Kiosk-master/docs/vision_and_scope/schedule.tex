\section{Schedule}

\subsection{Gantt Chart}
The initial task break-down schedule displayed graphically as a Gantt chart.
(see https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/gantt-chart/)
Gnatt charts list the tasks, show the length of each task, and dependencies
between tasks.  

\subsection{Key Milestones}
Milestones are points in the development where you have implemented some
number of major features.  For senior project, you generally have five
milestones: one at the end of 491, three in 492, and one in 493.
In this section, divide the Major Features between the milestones.  You should
front-load the schedule as much as possible.  That is, leave 10% of the work
for the last milestone.  

\subsection{Resource Assignments}
Resources include budgets, consumables like paint, and computing equipment
like servers and development systems.  Assign these resources, if any, to the
tasks, listed above. 

\subsection{Individual Responsibilities}
Who is responsible for which parts of the development effort.
